  :code:`instrupy/examples/example_instrument_specs/` directory.

Detailed documentation on all the InstruPy modules (and hence the instrument model descriptions) can be found in API Reference. 
Another useful source of example usage of the InstruPy modules is to see the test files of the corresponding modules in the /tests/ directory.
